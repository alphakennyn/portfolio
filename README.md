Hello my name is Kenny

## TODO

- App
    - Navigation button between pages (carousel style? tbd)
    - Animation
        - Step
            - 1 old page transitions (slide horizontally)
            - 2  new page transitions (slide horizontally)
            - 3 background color changes
    - Only page content should be scrollable (this will be tricky on mobile, since I'd want swipping for page navigation).
- Home
    - social media icons in description area
    - improve text?
    - better color?
- Job
    - page itself
    - styling
- Projects

    - mockup
    - the page itself
